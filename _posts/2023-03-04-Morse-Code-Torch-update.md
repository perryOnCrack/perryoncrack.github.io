After almost 3 years of abandonment of this little app I wrote as an assignment of a course I took, a new update is on its way to the Play Store in a few days.

**This update will be the 1.0 release!!!**

### 2 major changes in this update:

1. **UI refresh**:

    This update replace the original old & ugly UI with the new Material Me design language (though the color scheme won't be tied to your system's) and clean up the original messiness. The UI should be more clean and not so clogged up like the old one.

    Here's a sneak peak:

    | QCode hidden                                                                            | QCode expanded                                                                           |

2. **Backend upgrade**:

    I converted the code to Kotlin & refactored the most of them in this update, though performance should be the same as before.

### Some minor changes:

- Target API level changed from 29 to 33, minimum is still 23.

- That's it, nothing more.
