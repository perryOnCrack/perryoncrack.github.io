# **About Me**

A soon-to-be-software-developer photography enthusiast trying to write something about the thing he love on the World Wide Web, under the name perryOnCrack.

# **What to Expect From This Website**

I'm using this website as my photography blog and development blog for future software project. 

# **Past Projects**

* ### [Reverse Proxy for Jobe](https://github.com/perryOnCrack/Reverse-Proxy-for-Jobe)
    
    **A reverse proxy for https://github.com/trampgeek/jobe written in Python using Flask and Requests.**

    This is the project for my bachelor degree in computer science.
    
    It's a reverse proxy that implements Jobe's REST API in order to do load balancing over multiple Jobe servers instead of one like its original design. 
    
    Most of its code was written around July and August of 2020, I'm a little proud of myself for finish writing it from scratch in this short amount time.

    I'm thinking about doing a rewrite or update to this project because there's a lot of stuff I think I can redesign and improve.

* ### [Rock Paper Scissors VB](https://github.com/perryOnCrack/Rock-Paper-Scissors-VB)
    
    **A rock paper scissors game written in .NET Framework in VB.**
    
    It's a silly rock paper scissor game where you can choose if the player win every time or the program win every time.

    This project is not that serious of a project, it's for the final of a basic-level course I chose in my senior year. I finished this within 8 hours I think.

* ### [Kao The Kangaroo 2 PAK Tools](https://github.com/perryOnCrack/Kao-The-Kangaroo-2-PAK-Tools)
    
    **Script to unpack Kao2 steam version's .pak file.**

    This is my attempt to write a script to unpack this games .pak file using Python.

    It works but it's my earlier project so I might cringe if I look at some of its code.
