    - Use screen as a light source.
    - Use vibrator as a light(?) source.
    - Use multiple light sources at the same time.

- Other changes:
    - Removed unnecessary permission request.
    - Some background improvements.

- A known bug that I won't/can't do anything about it for now:
    - Morse code flavor drop-down menu sometimes will fail to open. This doesn't affect the app's functionality as there's only one flavor at the moment.

### Version 1.0 Hotfix 1 (2023-03-09)

- Fixed a bug where pressing the start button repeatedly would crash the app.
- I forgot to turn on some build optimization option in the last release, the app's size should be 1.1 MB now instead of 3.6 MB.

### Version 1.0 (2023-03-07)

- New Material 3 design.
- UI overhaul, it should be more clean and not so clogged up like the old one.
