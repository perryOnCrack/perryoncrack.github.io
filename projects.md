## Past Programming Projects

- ### Reverse Proxy for Jobe ([Github](https://github.com/perryOnCrack/Reverse-Proxy-for-Jobe))

    A reverse proxy for https://github.com/trampgeek/jobe written in Python using Flask and Requests.

    This is the graduation project for my bachelor degree in computer science.

    It's a reverse proxy that implements Jobe's REST API in order to do load balancing over multiple Jobe servers instead of one like its original design.

    Most of its code was written around July and August of 2020, I'm a little proud of myself for finish writing it from scratch in this short amount time.

    ~~I'm thinking about doing a rewrite or update to this project because there's a lot of stuff I think I can redesign and improve.~~

- ### Rock Paper Scissors VB ([Github](https://github.com/perryOnCrack/Rock-Paper-Scissors-VB))

    A rock paper scissors game written in .NET Framework in VB

    It's a silly rock paper scissor game where you can choose if the player win every time or the program win every time.

    This is kind of a joke project for me, it's for the final of a basic-level course I had in my senior year. I finished this within 8 hours from scratch.

- ### Kao The Kangaroo 2 PAK Tools ([Github](https://github.com/perryOnCrack/Kao-The-Kangaroo-2-PAK-Tools))

    A script to unpack Steam version Kao The Kangaroo 2's *.pak file

    This was my attempt to write a script to unpack this game's *.pak file using Python.

    It works well enough but it was my earlier project so part of the code made me cringe a little bit.
